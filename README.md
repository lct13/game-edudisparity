# game-edudisparity
A basic strategy/management game that addresses disparity issues in public schools.
Developed for the final project for CSE190C at UW Seattle.
Our game is structured to involve a district official setting policy, with a feedback cycle of several months, represented by a quarter. Each turn lasts a quarter and one policy can be enacted each quarter. Some special game mechanics we have are the crisis system and the one-time operators. The crisis system makes the game more difficult because it forces the player to face a drastic situation that pops up at regular intervals and sharply reduces multiple stats. The one-time operators only pop up once in the game so they canâ€™t be implemented at any stage like most of the operators. The key to winning the game is to maximize the state variables, represented by meters. The meters act as the scoring mechanism.
